Hi all, the name is Martijn and I generally like to tinker with all sorts of stuff.

By day, I am a backend python developer over at [codabox], a Belgian Leuven-based financial scale-up.
I am mostly fighting with python / django, docker and the like.

By night, I am obsessed with anything open source home automation.
